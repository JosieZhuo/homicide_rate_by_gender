```{r}
homicide_df =
  raw_data %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ","),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolve",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~"solved"
    )) %>%
  relocate(city_state) %>%
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", " Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")))
